# Introduction
This is the replication package for our work submitted to IEEE ACCESS, i.e., Hao Li, Tian Wang, Weifeng Pan, et al. Mining Key Classes in Java Projects by Examining a Very Small Number of Classes: A Complex Network based Approach. IEEE ACCESS, 2020, submitted. [[PDF](#)]

# CCNs
The CCNs directory contains the CCNs that we built for all the subject systems used in our experiments. It also contains the metric data of the classes in the corresponding software project using our approach and the approaches in the baseline. Note that we only provide some sample CCNs; the whole data set will be available after our work's acceptance. Of course, interested readers can email us (Email: wfpan@zjgsu.edu.cn) to get the whole data set in advance. Please use your institutional email address.

# MinClass
The MinClass directory contains the Python code which implements our MinClass approach and the approaches in the baseline. It is a small part of our own developped software, SNAP. Of course, the SNAP software can be obtained by emailing us (Email: wfpan@zjgsu.edu.cn).
